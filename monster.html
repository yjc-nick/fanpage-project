    <p>Anjanath</p>
    <p>Anjanath is a Brute Wyvern first introduced in Monster Hunter: World.</p>
    <p>Anjanath resembles a Tyrannosaurus; it has black and grey fur on its back which coupled with its flesh-toned scales, make it look similar to the archetypal image of a vulture. Its hide is primarily pink in color, while a dark pelt covers its back which ends in a ruff at the neck, leaving the head bald. Large fangs protrude from the monster's lower jaw, giving it the appearance of an under-bite. Anjanath's massive jaws are counterbalanced by its bulky tail, the underside of which is lined with quills.</p>

    <p>Alatreon</p>
    <p>Alatreon is an Elder Dragon introduced in Monster Hunter 3.</p>
    <p>Alatreon is elementally unstable, possessing control over the Dragon, Fire, Ice, Thunder and Water elements. When transitioning into Flight Mode, Alatreon will fly high into the air and can rain down ice crystals. Some ice crystals fall on random spots while others may target certain players. Alatreon will only use the Water elements while in the air. It is said that it has the abilities of all the True Elder Dragons (Kushala Daora, Chameleos, Lunastra, Teostra, Vaal Hazak, Velkhana and Namielle), although, since it is elementally unstable, it is unable to truly harness that power.</p>
